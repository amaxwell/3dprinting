## What is this

At this time, it's a way to distribute 3D printing models of parts for older
Tektronix gear. Directory names should be self-explanatory, and all you really
need is to download an STL file and load it into your slicer.

All of my test prints as of July 2024 have been with an Ender 3, and I use
PETG for final production.
